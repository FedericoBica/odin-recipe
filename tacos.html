        <li>1 jalape√±o</li>

    <h4>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To start with our Mexican tacos, we chop the garlic and cook 
            it over a very low heat for 1 minute. that does not take color
        </li>
        <li>
            Add half a kilo of tomatoes, already peeled and chopped, and increase 
            the power of the fire. Season and cook for a while. The tomato will release 
            water, all that should evaporate, it may take a while. Once evaporated, 
            let it cook over low heat while stirring constantly, for 5 more minutes, 
            so that it takes on a good flavor
        </li>
        <li>
            While the water from the tomatoes evaporates, prepare the pico de gallo. 
            Pico de gallo is a sauce that suits Mexican tacos. In a bowl we put all the 
            vegetables of this well chopped sauce. Add the juice of 1/2 lime or 
            half a lemon and stir well. Let rest
        </li>
        <li>
            When the tomato has cooked a bit, we add the minced meat that we have chosen. 
            Add your share of salt and pepper and cook over high heat. With a wooden spoon, 
            we are removing everything and shredding the minced meat, so that there are no 
            large pieces. In fact, the finer they are, the better. 
            So we mix with the tomato and garlic, while we shred it and cook the meat
        </li>
        <li>
            Once it's cooked, it's ready! Heat the tortillas one by one on both sides in a 
            skillet over medium heat. Then we put a few tablespoons of the meat on top, 
            season with a little pico de gallo, wrap them giving it the characteristic taco 
            shape. And it's ready! Optionally you can also sprinkle grated cheese on top.
